Scenario:
You are a medieval king attacking your opponent at five locations simultaneously
Each location has a platoon - which has a number of soldiers of a specific class
You know the platoons your opponent has
Your job is to figure out which of your platoons should attack which of your opponent's platoons so that you can win majority of the battles.
In general, one soldier of your platoon will be able to handle one soldier of your opponent's platoon
If your platoon has 100 soldiers and your opponent's platoon has:
* 99 soldiers - You Win
* 100 soldiers - Draw
* 101 soldiers - You Lose
Platoon Classes
There are 6 classes of soldiers:
- Militia
- Spearmen
- Light Cavalry
- Heavy Cavalry
- Foot Archer
- Cavalry Archer
Each class of soldier has an advantage over other classes of soldiers
Unit Class Advantage Over
Militia -> [ Spearmen, LightCavalry ]
Spearmen -> [ LightCavalry, HeavyCavalry ]
LightCavalry -> [ FootArcher, CavalryArcher ]
HeavyCavalry -> [ Militia, FootArcher, LightCavalry ]
CavalryArcher -> [ Spearmen, HeavyCavalry ]
FootArcher -> [ Militia, CavalryArcher ]
The soldiers who have advantage over the opponent, will be able to handle twice the amount of opponent's soldiers
If your platoon has 100 Spearmen and your opponent's platoon has:
* 199 HeavyCavalry - You Win
* 200 HeavyCavalry - Draw
* 201 HeavyCavalry - You Lose
The input to the problem statement is the list of platoons that you have with their classes and number of units in the first line
The second line contains the list of platoons of the opponent (PlatoonClasses#NoOfSoldiers)
Spearmen#10;Militia#30;FootArcher#20;LightCavalry#1000;HeavyCavalry#120
Militia#10;Spearmen#10;FootArcher#1000;LightCavalry#120;CavalryArcher#100
The output of the program should be to give a sequence in which you should arrange your platoons so that you win atleast 3 of the 5 battles.
There could be multiple winning arrangements, it is enough to print one of the possible arrangements
If there is no possibility to get atleast 3 out of 5 wins in any arrangement, it should intimate that with an error message that "There is no chance of winning"
Sample Input:
Spearmen#10;Militia#30;FootArcher#20;LightCavalry#1000;HeavyCavalry#120
Militia#10;Spearmen#10;FootArcher#1000;LightCavalry#120;CavalryArcher#100
Sample Output:
Militia#30;FootArcher#20;Spearmen#10;LightCavalry#1000;HeavyCavalry#120
Explanation:
Own Platoon Opponent Platoon Outcome
Battle 1 Militia#30 Militia#10 Win

Battle 2
FootArcher#20 Spearmen#10 Win
Battle 3 Spearmen#10 FootArcher#1000 Loss
Battle 4 LightCavalry#1000 LightCavalry#120 Win
Battle 5 HeavyCavalry#120 CavalryArcher#100 Loss
Own Platoon Opponent Platoon Outcome

Thus 3/5 battles can be won in this order.
